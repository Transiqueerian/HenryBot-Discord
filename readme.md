Hi,  i know nothing about github, programming, or readme's. 
My name is Gooplet (a.k.a. Transiqueerian) and I'm doing the best I can.
So please be patient ^.^
Right now, Henry is a Discord bot that interacts with the OGS api. 
He also uses sgf-render, which can be found at:
https://github.com/julianandrews/sgf-render
The fork we're using is by Purxiz.
